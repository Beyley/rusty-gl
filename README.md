# Rusty GL

## Summary

Very thin wrapper over gl-rs, aiming to make code more "rust-like" and safer, while still allowing the control you have with classic OpenGL code.

Wrapper over:

* Vertex buffer objects
* Vertex array objects
* Shaders
* Texture 2D

# Usage
```toml
[dependancies]
rusty_gl = "0.1.0"
```
